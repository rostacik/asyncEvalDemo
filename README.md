# asyncEvalDemo
Sample app to show how we can execute either sync or async function in JavaScript (I am using TypeScript + Babel here) defined just by string (that can be bound to element or passed as parameter)

I specified eval in the name just to indicate the most used means to achieve same functionality with previous versions of ECMAScript.
